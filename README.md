### ðŸ”– [Docker](https://github.com/Yakuphan-world/DevOps-Handson/tree/main/Docker)
Docker is a platform for developing, deploying, and running applications in containers. Containers are portable, lightweight environments that run isolated from the host operating system. Docker allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into containers, making them easy to deploy and manage across different environments. Docker provides a simple and consistent interface for building and managing containers, with a powerful command-line interface and a robust API.

### ðŸ”– [Docker_Swarm](https://github.com/Yakuphan-world/DevOps-Handson/tree/main/Docker_Swarm)
Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration solution for Docker containers. It allows you to create and manage a cluster of Docker nodes, which can be used to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale.

### ðŸ”– [Kubernetes](https://github.com/Yakuphan-world/DevOps-Handson/tree/main/Kubernetes)
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a platform-agnostic framework for deploying and managing applications in containers, and is widely used for building and running cloud-native applications.

### ðŸ”– [Terraform](https://github.com/Yakuphan-world/DevOps-Handson/tree/main/Terraform)
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers and on-premises data centers. It provides a platform-agnostic way to manage infrastructure, allowing you to use a consistent workflow to manage resources regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
